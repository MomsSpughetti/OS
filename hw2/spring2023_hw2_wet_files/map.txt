steps:
	add names to *.tbl
	add functions to syscalls.h
	add weight field to task_struct in include/linux/sched.h
	initialize to 0 in include/linux/init_task.h
	
	now:
		make son inherit weight from father by editing fork.c
		how to get to the father process? so we can return the sum!
		how to find childs and compare between them!
		
		
		NOTES:
			do not forget to edit makefile!!!!!!!!!

		Also bear in mind that you do not
		control the process tree, meaning that other kernel functions may change it without
		changing the fields you added.
		
		does this mean a new tree or something similiar and save all processes there?
		
		Notice that the default behavior of existing system calls such as fork and execv
		regarding the new process weight field is exactly the behavior that is required from
		you in this homework.
		
		so does this mean that we do not need to change fork.c?
		
		Check out the macros list_for_each and list_entry from
		include/linux/list.h. They could be useful.
