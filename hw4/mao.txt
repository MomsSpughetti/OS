for part 3:
	in sfree():
		when size > 128KiB use mmap()
	add merge that sfree() uses
	
	how to know if this block is a buddy?
		(1) use the trick:
			x = sbrk(0) -> get the current break address
			sbrk(x ???)
		(2) to know for a block x who is his buddy:
			x.size == x.prev.size && x.prev.is_free => prev is his buddy
			x.size == x.next.size && x.next.is_free => next is his buddy
			else no need to merge (buddy not free)
			because there can not be two free related buddies since sfree() uses merge()
	
	tasks:
		add new structure
		write merge function
		update smalloc:
			use mmap() when >128KiB
			use the existing blocks instead
			if <128KiB & no suitable block in heap -> sbrk(+)
		update srealloc:
		update functions 5-10
