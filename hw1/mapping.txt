jobs list:
	add vector to smash
	add process to vector if:
		process is stopped using ctrl+z
		process is a background process (only external)
jobs command:
	print the vector ordered by job-id
Note: before any operation - delete the finished jobs from vector!

questions:
	Q: where to add the jobs vector?
	A: in smash class
	Q: when to use fork other than in external commands?
	A: ?
	Q: how to pass signal to the current process (signals are sent to 'main' process)?
	A: ?
	Q: how to print vector in order?
	A: ?
	Q: when and where to delete finished jobs?
	A: finished jobs should be deleted in every while loop in main function
	Q: what should the vector contain?
	A: job objects (provided)

notes to M1:
	deleteing finished jobs should be done before moving to next loop (in main).
	shouldn't PID be a data member of command class? and from where PID value is set?
	why calling je->run() after 'kill(targetPID, SIGCONT)' (in backgroundCommand::execute())? shouldn't that be in handler code?
	should add the print line if succeeded in kill command execute().

To add:
	data member for smallShell class: 'Command *CurrCommand'. Then we can do whatever we want to the foreground process when main gets a signal!
