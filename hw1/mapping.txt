jobs list:
	add vector to smash
	add process to vector if:
		process is stopped using ctrl+z
		process is a background process (only external)
jobs command:
	print the vector ordered by job-id
Note: before any operation - delete the finished jobs from vector!

questions:
	Q: where to add the jobs vector?
	A: in smash class
	Q: when to use fork other than in external commands?
	A: for example when using pip. Mohamad
	Q: how to pass signal to the current process (signals are sent to 'main' process)?
	A: using kill syscall. Mohamad
	Q: how to print vector in order?
	A: According to the job ID. Mohamad
	Q: when and where to delete finished jobs?
	A: finished jobs should be deleted in every while loop in main function
	Q: what should the vector contain?
	A: job objects (provided)

notes to M1:
	deleteing finished jobs should be done before moving to next loop (in main).
	- yes, in addition we need to delete them before calling many functions, we will discuse that 
	when we review the code.
	shouldn't PID be a data member of command class? and from where PID value is set?
	- no, command will get deleted before getting into the next command to execute
		(there are work arounds, but that's working for now),jobs in the other hand are maintained until they finish or terminat.
	why calling je->run() after 'kill(targetPID, SIGCONT)' (in backgroundCommand::execute())? shouldn't that be in handler code?
	- faliure of kill() might cause a problem.
	should add the print line if succeeded in kill command execute().
	- The code need much more improvment, I cared about a semi-working version as early as possible.

To add:
	data member for smallShell class: 'Command *CurrCommand'. Then we can do whatever we want to the foreground process when main gets a signal!
	
	
		
problems:
	bg - (removeFinished is removing the process that gets SIGCONT)
	redirection command - fork() inside fork() - smash is written when it's not should be (solved)
	|& in pipe ... how you should handle the existence of &
